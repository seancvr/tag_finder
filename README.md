# Chrome tag finder

## Possible improvements

Areas for Improvement
1. Promise Handling
Several places use the Promise .then() pattern mixed with async/await. Standardizing on async/await throughout would make the code more consistent.
In the export.js file, document.removeChild(a) should be document.body.removeChild(a) to match where it was appended.
2. State Management
You're storing state in global variables (tagData, unmatchedUrlList) and also in storage. Consider a more consistent state management approach to avoid sync issues.
In the "remove entry" click handler, you retrieve data from storage even though you might have just updated it moments ago.
3. Link Handling
For the anchor tags created via innerHTML, consider using Chrome's tabs API for links to ensure they open correctly in incognito mode.
target="_blank" links from extension popups behave differently than from regular pages, especially in incognito mode.
4. UI/UX Enhancements
No loading indicators while waiting for data to load or operations to complete.
No confirmation for potentially destructive actions (like clearing all data).
The remove button (-) could benefit from a tooltip or confirmation.
5. Code Structure
The event listener setup is outside any initialization function, which works but may cause issues if DOM elements don't exist when the script runs.
The document.querySelector() calls are repeated; consider caching these references.
7. Potential Performance Optimizations
Repeatedly clearing and rebuilding entire DOM trees on updates (using innerHTML='') is inefficient for large datasets.
Consider incremental updates or using a lightweight virtual DOM approach.
8. Future Enhancements to Consider
Pagination for large result sets.
Filtering and sorting capabilities.
Better visual differentiation between different types of tags.
Tracking version history of scans.
Local search within detected tags.
